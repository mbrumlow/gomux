# gomux
This is a work in progress go based web server. The intention is to use it more along the lines as one would nginx or apache. One of the main goals of this project is to make live configuration changes via API without interrupting or restarting the service. 

## Key features (not all implemented yet) 

* Live configuration changes. 
* Rest API for configuration changes. 
* HTTP reverse proxies. 
* Websocket reverse proxies. 
* Let's Encrypt support.
